Hello World,

Thank you for visiting my website.

I am an epidemiologist specializing in causal inference based on
observational data analyses. I have extensive data science experience
using SAS and R to manage and analyze large relational healthcare
databases in collaborative coding environments to produce decision-grade
evidence. I educate trainees in epidemiology and biostatistics through
grounded in the principles of open science learned through practical
experience conducting applied research. My research interests include
critical illness survivorship, pharmacoepidemiology (drug safety and
effectiveness), pharmacoequity, drug utilization, public health program
performance measurement, infectious disease modelling, violence
epidemiology, race and ethnicity data, and structural missing data
investigations.

Sincerely,

**C. Andrew Basham, PhD**
