# About Me

My career path has been anything but linear. My values, principles, and vision however, remain as true today as when I first learned to identify, embody, and express them. Although making the world a better place is a bit cliche, it is so because so many of us understand it on a base level and do so instinctively or reflexively in our day to day lives. Whether personally, publicly, or professionally, we aim to leave a better world for the next generation and those that will follow.

Currently I am applying for faculty positions in epidemiology while remaining open to continuing my postdoctoral research training to establish my programs of research: survivorship epidemiology and foundations for pharmacoequity. Both of these centre on the lived experience of people and how they are represented in quantitative research using real-world data (hospital records, physician billing claims, disease registries). My goal is to advance community narratives within causal inference to allow communities to make inferences based on data about them, while enriching and completing causal models of critical illness and systematic racism and other forms of discrimination so they are relevant, realistic, and can created real-world impact through community-academic partnerships.

Thank you for visiting my site and please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or spot an error in the site. And of course I am open to communicating about collaboration if you see overlap in our scientific and/or policy interests.

Sincerely,
