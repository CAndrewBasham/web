Thank you for visiting my open-source [Quarto
website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

<!--# >My goal as an epidemiologist is to advance causal inference in the epidemiological research to enable individuals and communities to contribute to the design and interpretation of statistical analyses describing their lived experiences and influencing the policies, programs, and practices that impact their lives. <!--#  -->

<!--# The extensive skills and knowledge I bring to teaching are built on research integrity: relevance, rigour, reviewability, and reproducibility.  -->

I am an epidemiologist specializing in causal inference using large
relational healthcare databases. I have over 15 years experience using
SAS and R working in professional collaborative coding environments
producing decision-grade evidence with open science principles. As an
educator, I provide world-class training that students require to
prevail in highly competitive job markets.

Sincerely,

**C. Andrew Basham, PhD**
