Dr. C Andrew Basham, B.A., M.Sc., Ph.D.
:::

Thank you for visiting my open-source
website! This website was created to
illustrate my CV and to increase my GitHub
version-control and webdev skills.

This website was developed in RStudio and
Positron as an Rproject/Quarto project
coded in Quarto documents with .yaml
organizing them with a public GitHub
repository.

My career path has been anything but
linear; however, my values, principles, and
vision remain the same. My goal as an
epidemiologist is to advance community
narratives within causal epidemiological
research to enable individuals and
communities to contribute to the design and
interpretation of statistical analyses
describing their lived experiences and
influencing the policies, programs, and
practices that impact their lives.

If you see potential synergy between our
work and want to initiate a dialogue,
please do not hesitate to reach out. Also,
if see anything needs attention on this
site please let me know.

Sincerely,

**C. Andrew Basham, PhD**
