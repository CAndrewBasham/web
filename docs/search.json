    "text": "About Me\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nMy career path has been anything but linear. My values, principles, and vision however, remain as true today as when I first learned to identify, embody, and express them. Although making the world a better place is a bit cliche, it is so because so many of us understand it on a base level and do so instinctively or reflexively in our day to day lives. Whether personally, publicly, or professionally, we aim to leave a better world for the next generation and those that will follow.\nCurrently I am applying for faculty positions in epidemiology while remaining open to continuing my postdoctoral research training to establish two programs of research that I hope will help advance wellbeing for individuals surviving critical illnesses: Survivorship Epidemiology. Also, Foundations for Pharmacoequity in which I am leading an investigation of the sources, definitions, roles/uses, and implications of race and ethnicity data in healthcare databases, specifically Medicaid and Medicare enrollment data linked to electronic health record (EHR).\nBoth of these programs of research centre on the lived experience of people and how they are represented in quantitative research using real-world data (hospital records, physician billing claims, disease registries, and surveys of patients or the general population).\nMy goal is to advance community narratives within causal epidemiological modelling studies to allow communities to contribute meaningful interpretations of data analyses about their lived experiences. Direct involvement of survivors in epidemiological research through mixed methods will enrich causal model descriptions and the identification of intervention targets meaningful to patient.\nThank you for visiting my site and please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or spot an error in the site. And of course I am open to communicating about collaboration if you see potential synergy between our work.\nSincerely,\nC.
