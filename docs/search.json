Does the lenght of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis mediate the risk of depression caused by TB? To answer these research questions, I planned and conducted a causal mediation analysis of depression risk following tuberculosis diagnosis. Furthermore, I formally evaluated the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis. Results were presented at two conferences and then published."
