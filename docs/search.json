Does the lenght of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis mediate the risk of depression caused by TB? To answer these research questions, I planned and conducted a causal mediation analysis of depression risk following tuberculosis diagnosis. In that analysis, the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis was evaluated. Results were presented at two conferences and then published in an academic journal.\n\nSymposium Speaker - World Conference on Lung Health 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\n\n\nOral Abstract - International Union Against TB and Lund Disease, North America Region 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal Article"
