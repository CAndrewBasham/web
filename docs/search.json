In that analysis, the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis was evaluated.

Multilevel modelling course at York University – Summer Program in Data Analysis using the R language.\nProficient in SAS and R statistical programming. Strong data documentation and literate programming in both, including use of R markdown and Quarto documents within Rprojects version-controlled through Git with remote GitHub repositoryies for reproducible analysis reports.\nSkilled in applying macros for health administrative data linkage and analysis, including:\n\nthe Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics’ (DoPE’s) Pharmacoepidemiology Toolbox’s implemetation of the high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS), @schneeweiss2009\n%CEM (coarsened exact matching) @berta2017\nCharlson, Elixhauser, and Combined Comorbidity Index ascertainment macros. @quan2005; @quan2011; @vanwalraven2009; @gagne2011.\n\nDetailed knowledge of tuberculosis registry data in Manitoba and British Columbia through direct experience with these data, including developing case definitions based on laboratory, contact, diagnostic, and treatment data. & Privacy Training in Population Data BC Privacy 101, 201 Training, Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP) Accreditation, and University of Manitoba Personal Health Information Act (PHIA) and Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Act (FIPPA) online training.\n\nHealth Policy Analysis working in Indigenous health policy, planning, and program evaluation.

This website was created to illustrate my CV and to increase my GitHub version-control and webdev skills.\nThis website was developed in RStudio and Positron as an Rproject/Quarto project coded in Quarto documents with .yaml organizing them with a public GitHub repository.\nMy career path has been anything but linear; however, my values, principles, and vision remain the same. My goal as an epidemiologist is to advance community narratives within causal epidemiological research to enable individuals and communities to contribute to the design and interpretation of statistical analyses describing their lived experiences and influencing the policies, programs, and practices that impact their lives.\nIf you see potential synergy between our work and want to initiate a dialogue or potential collaboration, please do not hesitate to reach out. Also, if see anything needs attention on this site please let me know.\nSincerely,\nC.
