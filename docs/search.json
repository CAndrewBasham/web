    "text": "About Me\nMy career path has been anything but linear. My values, principles, and vision however, remain as true today as when I first learned to identify, embody, and express them. Although making the world a better place is a bit cliche, it is so because so many of us understand it on a base level and do so instinctively or reflexively in our day to day lives. Whether personally, publicly, or professionally, we aim to leave a better world for the next generation and those that will follow.\nCurrently I am applying for faculty positions in epidemiology while remaining open to continuing my postdoctoral research training to establish my programs of research: survivorship epidemiology and foundations for pharmacoequity. Both of these centre on the lived experience of people and how they are represented in quantitative research using real-world data (hospital records, physician billing claims, disease registries). My goal is to advance community narratives within causal inference to allow communities to make inferences based on data about them, while enriching and completing causal models of critical illness and systematic racism and other forms of discrimination so they are relevant, realistic, and can created real-world impact through community-academic partnerships.\nThank you for visiting my site and please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or spot an error in the site. And of course I am open to communicating about collaboration if you see overlap in our scientific and/or policy interests.\nSincerely,\nC. Andrew Basham, BA, MSc, PhD\nOctober 30th, 2024\nCambridge, MA"

    "text": "Through knowledge generation and synthesis, my research informs prevention, diagnosis, and care for people diagnosed with TB internationally.\n\n\nMy first research interest was in TB epidemiology and program performance measurement through an equity lens. This interest was borne from my work with the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak ( for “Northern Manitoba Chiefs”), as a Health Policy Analyst My MSc thesis was based on working on the MKO TB Strategy, which included a project called “Finding Our Ancestors” and a call for the US-CDC Program Objectives and Performance Targets to be applied to the TB programming provided to MKO First Nations to ensure transparent review aimed at eliminating TB with community partnership established based on that common goal.\n\n\n\nMy PhD thesis Tuberculosis Survivor Health investigated long-term health outcomes of people diagnosed with TB compared with non-TB controls using causal inference epidemiological methods.\n\n\n\nI focused on TB and mental health as a key component of my PhD thesis research on TB survivor health. In addition to my research I served as an Executive Member on the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease TB-Mental Health Working Group.\n\n\nI was a co-organizer of this World TB Day 2021 Webinar Integrating TB and Mental Health Services to End the Epidemic and presented an overview of systematic reviews on TB and mental health - focused on depression.\n\n\nThis presentation led to a 1:1 knowledge exchange with Dr Paula Fujiwara, which informed the structure and content of the USAID discussion document she was authoring on this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan TB lead to a higher risk of depression? Does the lenght of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis mediate the risk of depression caused by TB? To answer these research questions, I planned and conducted a causal mediation analysis of depression risk following tuberculosis diagnosis. In that analysis, the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis was evaluated.
