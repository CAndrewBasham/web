    "text": "About Me\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nMy career path has been anything but linear. My values, principles, and vision however, remain as true today as when I first learned to identify, embody, and express them. Although making the world a better place is a bit cliche, it is so because so many of us understand it on a base level and do so instinctively or reflexively in our day to day lives. Whether personally, publicly, or professionally, we aim to leave a better world for the next generation and those that will follow.\nMy goal as an epidemiologist is to advance community narratives within causal epidemiological research to enable individuals and communities to contribute to the meaningful design and interpretation of statistical analyses about their lived experiences. In particular, direct involvement of survivors of critical illnesses in epidemiological modelling of survivorship as a long-term life-altering process with many exposures, treatments, and outcomes (short, medium, and long-term).\nThank you for visiting my site and please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or spot an error in the site. And of course I am open to communicating about collaboration if you see potential synergy between our work.\nSincerely,\nC.

     care, oncology, and infectious disease) in which survivorship is            studied quantitatively; creating a critical mass of             epidemiologists across fields dedicated to methodological           research for            survivorship.            I propose to mix causal inference quantitative theory and methods          with the rich qualitative work done on survivorship within fields           and to build bridges across fields to identify generalizable            strategies, methods, and tools to address common problems such as           comparator          selection, decomposing the          causal effects of critical illness in terms of physical illness             effects,            treatment effects,          socioeconomic repercussions,            and the psychological ramifications             of          surviving critical illnesses. |\n                        |   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Local Teaching and Training\nLocal Invited presentations (last 3 years):\nNo presentations below were sponsored by 3rd parties/outside entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      07/2021   |   |             Towards             survivorship epidemiology: a post-doctoral fellowship application           / Oral                                                                                           |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n      |   | Division          of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's          Hospital, Boston, MA                                                                           |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      12/2022   |   |             Trends          and characteristics of tramadol utilization in the United States,           2004-2021 / Oral                                                                                  |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                                      |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n      |   | Division          of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's          Hospital, Boston, MA                                                                           |   |\n      |   |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      03/2023   |   |             Diseases            as drugs: a target trial emulation framework for survivorship           epidemiology?

A          key implement for *Causing          Careers*            will            be self-directed            acyclic graphs (self-DAGs).              Self-DAGs          create immediate relevance for learning DAGs            by          focusing on each individuals career             goals           (long-term          and intermediate positions          as          outcomes).           By explicitly linking education            and/or          training exposures/interventions assumed to causative           (necessarily            or sufficiently) or             at least contribute substantially) to realizing career outcomes.            Potential confounding factors (time-varying or baseline with            fixed           effects or interactions             with education exposure or third variable(s), as assumed with           rationale provided by the trainee). These may affect both their             education/training and career outcomes which can be discussed in            terms of subject matter and in training students to understand          differences between confounding, mediating, and other variables.            Trainees that can identify potential confounding on their career            and education pathways may devise approaches to “adjust” away           or otherwise block all backdoor paths between education exposure            and career outcome). Furthermore, baseline effect modification of           the education/training can be included in text descriptions             developed alongside the career causal graphs. Using publicly            available Daggity.net software ([[https://dagitty.net/]{.underline}](https://dagitty.net/))             trainees will draw these career DAGs or self-DAGs           that            identify their specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and          timebound (SMART) career goals (outcomes) and will describe             educational interventions (exposures) to cause this goal. A             starting exercise will be considering the *Causing          Career’s*           first goal of causal inference education, where we describe the             concepts that define intended outcomes of the course.        |\n

In that analysis, the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis was evaluated.
