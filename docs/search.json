Role: Research Lead. Aims: (1) investigate structural missingness of race and ethnicity in EHR and claims data, comparing missing vs non-missing in terms of sociodemographics, health conditions, healthcare utilization; (2) evaluate concordance of race and ethnicity in claims data compared with EHR data taking into account missingness; (3) thoroughly document race and ethnicity variables available in Medicare and Medicaid benefits and enrolment files and Mass General Brigham (MGB) EHR. 10/2023-ongoing “Multilevel drug utilization trend analysis: a reproducible R and SAS tutorial.” Funding: None. Role: Principal Investigator. Aims: (1) create a tutorial on multilevel and mixed effects modeling of aggregate count data that estimates trends for numerous aggregating units (e.g., states) that is reproducible with open source R code provided freely through a public GitHub repository; (2) develop a participatory workshop that can train, and (3) build an online learning community for mixed effect and multilevel modelling in pharmacoepidemiology. 01/2021-ongoing (unfunded) “Survivorship Epidemiology”. Funding: None. Aims: The purpose of survivorship epidemiology is to share knowledge and advance theory and methods across fields of medicine (critical care, oncology, and infectious disease) in which survivorship is studied quantitatively; creating a critical mass of epidemiologists across fields dedicated to methodological research for survivorship. I propose to mix causal inference quantitative theory and methods with the rich qualitative work done on survivorship within fields and to build bridges across fields to identify generalizable strategies, methods, and tools to address common problems such as comparator selection, decomposing the causal effects of critical illness in terms of physical illness effects, treatment effects, socioeconomic repercussions, and the psychological ramifications of surviving critical illnesses.\nReport of Local Teaching and Training Local Invited presentations (last 3 years): No presentations below were sponsored by 3rd parties/outside entities. 07/2021 Towards survivorship epidemiology: a post-doctoral fellowship application / Oral Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 12/2022 Trends and characteristics of tramadol utilization in the United States, 2004-2021 / Oral Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 03/2023 Diseases as drugs: a target trial emulation framework for survivorship epidemiology? / Oral Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 05/2023 Multiple-Bias Sensitivity Analysis using Bounds / Journal Club Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA 10/2023 Foundations for Pharmacoequity: Missing and misclassified race and ethnicity in linked electronic health records and Medicare and Medicaid claims data, 2000-2020 / Oral.

[grant funding from AHRQ supported travel, accommodations, and registration].\nReport of Teaching and Education Innovations Causing Careers: a causal inference approach to planning education and training exposures aimed at achieving long-term work and life goals as mediated by real-world experiences. Causing careers has three objectives: (1) educating trainees in causal inference, (2) formalizing career planning through causal inference framework terminology, applying epidemiological concepts with methodological tools such as DAGs, PICOs, 2x2 tables, and basic probability theory while introducing counterfactual reasoning within the potential outcomes framework, and (3) contributing to the epidemiology’s scant pedagogical research. A key implement for Causing Careers will be self-directed acyclic graphs (self-DAGs). Self-DAGs create immediate relevance for learning DAGs by focusing on each individuals career goals (long-term and intermediate positions as outcomes). By explicitly linking education and/or training exposures/interventions assumed to causative (necessarily or sufficiently) or at least contribute substantially) to realizing career outcomes. Potential confounding factors (time-varying or baseline with fixed effects or interactions with education exposure or third variable(s), as assumed with rationale provided by the trainee). These may affect both their education/training and career outcomes which can be discussed in terms of subject matter and in training students to understand differences between confounding, mediating, and other variables. Trainees that can identify potential confounding on their career and education pathways may devise approaches to “adjust” away or otherwise block all backdoor paths between education exposure and career outcome). Furthermore, baseline effect modification of the education/training can be included in text descriptions developed alongside the career causal graphs. Using publicly available Daggity.net software (https://dagitty.net/) trainees will draw these career DAGs or self-DAGs that identify their specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timebound (SMART) career goals (outcomes) and will describe educational interventions (exposures) to cause this goal. A starting exercise will be considering the Causing Career’s first goal of causal inference education, where we describe the concepts that define intended outcomes of the course.\nReport of Education of Patients and Service to the Community Those presentations below sponsored by outside entities are so noted and the sponsor(s) is (are) identified.
