## Overview

This page contains software I have
developed over the years. I will be
uploading sporadically but my aim is to
publish all code used in papers I've first
authored or co-authored.

## This Website

1.  This is a [Quarto
    Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)
    .

2.  Quarto websites are a type of [RStudio
    Project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).

3.  Built and is maintained in
    [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
    and
    [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/).

4.  Each webpage is edited as a [Quarto
    document](https://quarto.org/).

5.  A [YAML file](https://yaml.org/) is
    used to organize the Quarto document
    webpages into a functional website.

6.  The updated files are committed to my
    local [**Git**
    Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
    used for version control.

7.  The committed changes are pushed to the
    remote [**GitHub**
    Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)
    which uploading any new files
    simultaneously

8.  The remote repository GitHub files are
    then processed with [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) -
    automatically triggered by the git
    push - which builds and deploys the
    Quarto website to [GitHub
    Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
    forming this website:
    <https://candrewbasham.github.io/web/>.
