# Tuberculosis Survivor Health

## Tuberculosis and Mental Health

Through knowledge generation and synthesis, my research has informed mental health research and care for TB survivors internationally.

### **World TB Day Webinar on TB-Mental Health Integration** 

I was a co-organizer of this webinar as a member of the TB-Mental Health Working Group of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease.

### [**USAID Report on TB and Mental Health**](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/TB_and_Mental_Health_USAID_REPORT_FINALTRACKED_EDITS_AG_508c_1.pdf) 

This review of evidence was structured based on an overview of systematic reviews that I presented on World TB Day during a TB-Mental Health Integration.

### TB and the risk of depression

Can TB lead to a higher risk of depression? Does the lenght of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis mediate the risk of depression caused by TB? To answer these research questions, I planned and conducted a causal mediation analysis of depression risk following tuberculosis diagnosis. Furthermore, I formally evaluated the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis. Results were presented at two conferences and then published.

# TB and Indigenous Peoples

As [Chair of the Global Stop TB Initiative (GISI) of the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease](https://theunion.org/global-indigenous-stop-tb-initiative), I strengthened our organization and bond with Communities, Alliances, and Networks (CAAN).
