## One Vision Many Paths: Podcast Interview

During this interview, I was invited to share information about TB for a podcast raising awareness of TB among Indigenous Peoples and advancing Indigenous solutions. I also shared perspectives and from my experience working in Northern Manitoba on TB.

# Tuberculosis (TB)

Through knowledge generation and synthesis, my research informs prevention, diagnosis, and care for people diagnosed with TB internationally.

## Tuberculosis Survivor Health

My PhD thesis [Tuberculosis Survivor Health](https://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0402446) investigated long-term health outcomes of people diagnosed with TB compared with non-TB controls using causal inference epidemiological methods.

### Tuberculosis and Mental Health

I focused on TB and mental health as a key component of my PhD thesis research on TB survivor health. In addition to my research I served as an Executive Member on the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease TB-Mental Health Working Group.

#### **World TB Day Webinar on TB-Mental Health Integration**  {#sec-world-tb-day-webinar-on-tb-mental-health-integration-}

I was a co-organizer of this World TB Day 2021 Webinar *Integrating TB and Mental Health Services to End the Epidemic* and presented an overview of systematic reviews on TB and mental health - focused on depression.

#### **USAID Evidence on TB and Mental Health**  {#sec-usaid-evidence-on-tb-and-mental-health-}

This review of evidence was structured based on the overview of systematic reviews presented during theWorld TB Day 2021 Webinar: *Integrating TB and Mental Health Services to End the Epidemic* ([above](https://youtu.be/eDH98iF-CBo)).

#### TB and the risk of depression

Can TB lead to a higher risk of depression? Does the lenght of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis mediate the risk of depression caused by TB? To answer these research questions, I planned and conducted a causal mediation analysis of depression risk following tuberculosis diagnosis. In that analysis, the potential mediating role of the length of stay in hospital following TB diagnosis was evaluated. Results were presented at two conferences and then published in *Annals of Epidemiology*.
