TI  - Multimorbidity prevalence and chronic disease patterns among tuberculosis 
      survivors in a high-income setting.
PG  - 264-276

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multimorbidity is the presence of two or more chronic health 
      conditions. Tuberculosis (TB) survivors are known to have higher prevalence of 
      multimorbidity, although prevalence estimates from high-income low-TB incidence 
      jurisdictions are not available and potential differences in the patterns of 
      chronic disease among TB survivors with multimorbidity are poorly understood. In 
      this study, we aimed to (1) compare the prevalence of multimorbidity among TB 
      survivors with matched non-TB controls in a high-income setting; (2) assess the 
      robustness of aim 1 analyses to different modelling strategies, unmeasured 
      confounding, and misclassification bias; and (3) among people with 
      multimorbidity, elucidate chronic disease patterns specific to TB survivors. 
      METHODS: A population-based cohort study of people immigrating to British 
      Columbia, Canada, 1985-2015, using health administrative data. Participants were 
      divided into two groups: people diagnosed with TB (TB survivors) and people not 
      diagnosed with TB (non-TB controls) in British Columbia. Coarsened exact matching 
      (CEM) balanced demographic, immigration, and socioeconomic covariates between TB 
      survivors and matched non-TB controls. Our primary outcome was multimorbidity, 
      defined as ≥2 chronic diseases from the Elixhauser comorbidity index. RESULTS: In 
      the CEM-matched sample (n=1962 TB survivors; n=1962 non-TB controls), we 
      estimated that 21.2% of TB survivors (n=416), compared with 12% of non-TB 
      controls (n=236), had multimorbidity. In our primary analysis, we found a 
      double-adjusted prevalence ratio of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.49-2.05) between TB survivors 
      and matched non-TB controls for multimorbidity. Among people with multimorbidity, 
      differences were observed in chronic disease frequencies between TB survivors and 
      matched controls. CONCLUSION: TB survivors had a 74% higher prevalence of 
      multimorbidity compared with CEM-matched non-TB controls. TB-specific 
      multimorbidity patterns were observed through differences in chronic disease 
      frequencies between the matched samples. These findings suggest a need for 
      TB-specific multimorbidity interventions in high-income settings such as Canada. 
      We suggest TB survivorship as a framework for developing person-centred 
      interventions for multimorbidity among TB survivors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of tuberculosis (TB)-associated depression. A 
      second aim was to estimate the extent to which any increased risk of depression 
      among TB patients may be mediated by the length of hospital length stay (LOS) 
      METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of linked healthcare claims and public health 
      surveillance data. Our primary outcome, time-to-depression, was analyzed using 
      Cox proportional hazards (PH) regressions. Causal mediation analysis was used to 
      estimate the natural direct and indirect effect of TB mediated by hospital LOS. 
      RESULTS: Among 755,836 participants (52.2% female, median age=35 years, median 
      follow-up=8.75 years), 2295 were diagnosed with TB (exposure), and 128,963 were 
      diagnosed with depression (outcome). We observed a covariate-adjusted hazard 
      ratio (aHR) of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.14-1.34) for depression by TB. The total effect of 
      TB on depression was decomposed into a natural direct effect of TB of aHR=1.11 
      (95% CI, 1.02-1.21) and an indirect effect through hospital LOS of aHR=1.11 (95% 
      CI, 1.10-1.12), indicating that TB's total effect was mediated by 50% (95% CI, 
      35-82%) through hospital LOS. CONCLUSIONS: TB patients had a 24% higher risk of 
      developing depression. TB's effect was mediated substantially by hospital LOS, 
      requiring further study. Depression screening among TB patients is warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tramadol has been associated with chronic opioid use and emergency 
      room (ER) visits. However, little is known about trends in prescription tramadol 
      use in the U.S. METHODS: Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database 
      was used to assess trends in monthly incident and prevalent tramadol use from 
      2005 to 2021, stratified by sex and age (18-64 vs. ≥65 years). State-specific 
      trends following scheduling of tramadol as Class IV controlled substance in 
      August 2014 were analyzed with random effects regression models. Demographics, 
      comorbidities, initiation setting, dose, and co-dispensing with other opioids and 
      central nervous system (CNS) agents were assessed in people initiating tramadol, 
      stratified by age and initiation year (2005-2010, 2011-2015, 2016-2021). Analyses 
      were performed in 2023 and 2024. RESULTS: During 2005-2021, the mean percentage 
      using tramadol in a given month was 0.88% of younger females, 0.55% of younger 
      males, 1.97% of older females, and 1.14% of older males; 5,729,652 initiations 
      were identified. Since 2014, estimated relative yearly decrease was 4% (95% CI 
      3%; 5%) in use and 5% (95% CI 4%; 5%) in initiation, with variation across 
      states. Primary care percentage of tramadol initiations declined from 49.2% in 
      2005-2010 to 37.2% in 2016-2021. During 2016-2021, co-dispensing with other CNS 
      agents occurred in 37.8% of younger and 32.1% of older adults initiating 
      tramadol. CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol use was higher in females and older adults, 
      exhibited heterogeneous trends across states, and shifted from primary care to ER 
      and specialist settings over time. Co-dispensing with other CNS agents was common 
      and warrants further monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection and its management influence 
      tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes is uncertain. We synthesized evidence on the 
      association of SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (Coinfection Review) and its management 
      (Clinical Management Review) on treatment outcomes among people with tuberculosis 
      (TB) disease. METHODS: We systematically searched the literature from 1 January 
      2020 to 6 February 2022. Primary outcomes included: unfavorable (death, treatment 
      failure, loss-to-follow-up) TB treatment outcomes (Coinfection and Clinical 
      Management Review) and/or severe or critical COVID-19 or death (Clinical 
      Management Review). Study quality was assessed with an adapted Newcastle Ottawa 
      Scale. Data were heterogeneous and a narrative review was performed. An updated 
      search was performed on April 3, 2023. FINDINGS: From 9,529 records, we included 
      11 studies and 7305 unique participants. No study reported data relevant to our 
      review in their primary publication and data had to be contributed by study 
      authors after contact. Evidence from all studies was low quality. Eight studies 
      of 5749 persons treated for TB (286 [5%] with SARS-CoV-2) were included in the 
      Coinfection Review. Across five studies reporting our primary outcome, there was 
      no significant association between SARS-CoV-2 coinfection and unfavorable TB 
      treatment outcomes. Four studies of 1572 TB patients-of whom 291 (19%) received 
      corticosteroids or other immunomodulating treatment-were included in the Clinical 
      Management Review, and two addressed a primary outcome. Studies were likely 
      confounded by indication and discordant findings existed among studies. When 
      updating our search, we still did not identify any study reporting data relevant 
      to this review in their primary publication. INTERPRETATION: No study was 
      designed to answer our research questions of interest. It remains unclear whether 
      TB/SARS-CoV-2 and its therapeutic management are associated with unfavorable 
      outcomes. Research is needed to improve our understanding of risk and optimal 
      management of persons with TB and SARS-CoV-2 infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unmeasured confounding poses a serious threat to observational 
      studies of post-TB health outcomes. E-values have been recently proposed as a 
      method to assess the magnitude of unmeasured confounding necessary to nullify, or 
      to render non-significant, relative effect estimates from observational studies. 
      METHODS: We calculated E-values for both the risk ratio (RR) point estimates and 
      their lower 95% confidence limits (LCL) from studies of post-TB mortality, 
      respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) included in published 
      systematic reviews within and across post-TB outcome domains. We also employed a 
      meta-analytic E-value approach to estimate the proportion of unconfounded study 
      RRs greater than 1.1 at different levels of unmeasured confounding. RESULTS: 
      Across post-TB health outcome domains, we observed a median E-value of 5.59 
      (IQR = 3.19-7.35) for RRs, and 2.95 (IQR = 1.71-4.61) for LCLs. Post-TB mortality 
      studies had higher median E-values (E-value(RR) = 6.90 and E-value(LCL) = 4.54) 
      than studies of respiratory disease (E-value(RR) = 5.59, E-value(LCL) = 2.94) or 
      CVD (E-value(RR) = 3.90, E-value(LCL) = 1.81). The E-value at which the estimated 
      proportion of studies with unconfounded RRs greater than 1.1 would remain over 
      0.7 was 3.45 for post-TB mortality, 3.96 for post-TB respiratory disease, and 
      1.71 for post-TB CVD meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Unmeasured confounding with an 
      association of 2.95 or greater with both the exposure (TB) and outcome, on the 
      risk ratio scale, could render most post-TB health studies' findings 
      statistically non-significant. Post-TB mortality and respiratory disease studies 
      had higher E-values than TB-CVD studies, indicating that either (a) TB-CVD 
      studies may be more susceptible to unmeasured confounding bias, or (b) the true 
      effect of TB on CVD is lower.

TI  - Examining gender and sexual orientation differences in physical intimate partner 
      violence experienced and perpetrated by youth living in eThekwini district South 
      Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young women and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Non-binary/no gender, 
      or Questioning (LGBTQ+) youth in South Africa face some of the highest global 
      levels of intimate partner violence (IPV). Given limited evidence in the wake of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, which has fuelled IPV globally, we aimed to describe and 
      compare experiences and perpetration of IPV of youth aged 16-24 by sexual 
      orientation and gender identity (SOGI). METHODS: During the study period 
      (December 2021-May 2022), youth aged 16-24 from eThekwini district, South Africa 
      completed an online survey to understand multilevel impacts of the pandemic on 
      youth. Participants were asked about experiences and perpetration of physical IPV 
      since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020). Descriptive statistics and 
      adjusted logistic regressions compared the likelihood of experiencing and/or 
      perpetrating physical IPV between cisgender and transgender inclusive 
      heterosexual men; heterosexual women; gay, bisexual, or questioning men [GBQM]; 
      lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning women [LGBQW]; or gender/sexual 
      non-conforming youth [non-conforming]. RESULTS: Of 1,588 youth (mean age = 21.7 
      [SD = 2.3]; 71.7% Black) with non-missing SOGI and physical IPV data, 238 (15.0%) 
      were LGBTQ+ (40.3% LGBQW and 36.1% non-conforming). Overall, 14.6% of respondents 
      experienced physical IPV and 9.8% perpetrated physical IPV since the start of the 
      pandemic, which differed by SOGI (12.3% of heterosexual men, 13.9% of 
      heterosexual women, 22.0% of GBQM, 18.2% of LGBQW, and 25.0% of non-conforming 
      youth experienced and 10.3% of heterosexual men; 7.7% of heterosexual women; 
      10.0% of GBQM; 18.2% of LGBQW; and 16.7% of non-conforming youth perpetrated). In 
      adjusted models, compared to heterosexual women, non-conforming youth had 
      increased odds of experiencing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; 95%CI, 
      1.26-4.39) physical IPV and compared to heterosexual men, non-conforming youth 
      had greater odds of perpetrating physical IPV (aOR = 2.19; 95%CI, 
      1.07-4.48) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Over one in six youth in our study 
      experienced and one in ten perpetrated physical IPV since the onset of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, with gender and sexual non-conforming youth experiencing and 
      perpetrating IPV at significantly greater rates than cisgender/heterosexual 
      peers. Our findings highlight the need for gender transformative efforts that 
      move beyond the gender binary to support healthy relationships and IPV prevention 
      for LGBTQ + youth in South Africa and globally.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emerging epidemiological evidence of increased cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) risk among persons diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) has not been 
      systematically reviewed to date. Our aim was to review the existing 
      epidemiological evidence for elevated risk of CVD morbidity and mortality among 
      persons diagnosed with TB compared to controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EMBASE, 
      MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched (inception to January 2020) for 
      terms related to "tuberculosis" and "cardiovascular diseases". Inclusion 
      criteria: trial, cohort, or case-control study design; patient population 
      included persons diagnosed with TB infection or disease; relative risk (RR) 
      estimate and confidence interval reported for CVD morbidity or mortality compared 
      to suitable controls. Exclusion criteria: no TB or CVD outcome definition; 
      duplicate study; non-English abstract; non-human participants. Two reviewers 
      screened studies, applied ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias, and extracted 
      data independently. Random effects meta-analysis estimated a pooled RR of CVD 
      morbidity and mortality for persons diagnosed with TB compared to controls. 
      RESULTS: 6,042 articles were identified, 244 full texts were reviewed, and 16 
      were included, meta-analyzing subsets of 8 studies' RR estimates. We estimated a 
      pooled RR of 1.51 (95% CI: 1.16-1.97) for major adverse cardiac events among 
      those diagnosed with TB compared to non-TB controls (p = 0.0024). A 'serious' 
      pooled risk of bias was found across studies with between-study heterogeneity (I2 
      = 75.3%). CONCLUSIONS: TB appears to be a marker for increased CVD risk; however, 
      the literature is limited and is accompanied by serious risk of confounding bias 
      and evidence of publication bias. Further retrospective and prospective studies 
      are needed. Pending this evidence, best practice may be to consider persons 
      diagnosed with TB at higher risk of CVD as a precautionary measure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current epidemiological evidence of post-TB airway disease is largely 
      cross-sectional and derived from high-TB-incidence settings. We present the first 
      cohort study of post-TB airway disease in a low-TB-incidence setting. AIMS: (1) 
      analyze the risk of airway disease by respiratory TB, (2) assess potential 
      unmeasured confounding between TB and airway disease, and (3) investigate TB 
      effect measure modification. METHODS: A population-based cohort study using 
      healthcare claims data for immigrants to British Columbia (BC), Canada, 
      1985-2015. Airway disease included chronic airway obstruction, asthma, 
      bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and emphysema. Respiratory TB was defined from TB 
      registry data. Cox proportional hazards (PH) regressions were used to analyze 
      time-to-airway disease by respiratory TB. Sensitivity analyses included varying 
      definitions of TB and airway disease. Potential unmeasured confounding by smoking 
      was evaluated by E-value and hybrid least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO)-high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS). FINDINGS: In our 
      cohort (N = 1 005 328; n(TB)=1141) there were 116 840 incident cases of airway 
      disease during our 30-year study period (10.43 per 1,000 person-years of 
      follow-up), with cumulative incidence of 42·5% among respiratory TB patients 
      compared with 11·6% among non-TB controls. The covariate-adjusted hazard ratio 
      (aHR) for airway disease by respiratory TB was 2·08 (95% CI: 1·91-2·28) with 
      E-value=3·58. The LASSO-hdPS analysis produced aHR=2·26 (95% CI: 2·07-2·47). 
      INTERPRETATION: A twofold higher risk of airway disease was observed among 
      immigrants diagnosed with respiratory TB, compared with non-TB controls, in a 
      low-TB-incidence setting. Unmeasured confounding is unlikely to explain this 
      relationship. Models of post-TB care are needed. FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare Canadian homicide mortality rates (HMRs) and 
      trends in HMRs across age groups, with a focus on trends for youth. METHODS: Data 
      for the period of 2000 to 2009 were collected from Statistics Canada's CANSIM 
      (Canadian Statistical Information Management) Table 102-0540 with the following 
      ICD-10-CA coded external causes of death: X85 to Y09 (assault) and Y87.1 
      (sequelae of assault). Annual population counts from 2000 to 2009 were obtained 
      from Statistics Canada's CANSIM Table 051-0001. Both death and population counts 
      were organized into five-year age groups. A random effects negative binomial 
      regression analysis was conducted to estimate age group-specific rates, rate 
      ratios, and trends in homicide mortality. RESULTS: There were 9,878 homicide 
      deaths in Canada during the study period. The increase in the overall homicide 
      mortality rate (HMR) of 0.3% per year was not statistically significant (95% CI: 
      -1.1% to +1.8%). Canadians aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years had the highest HMRs 
      during the study period, and experienced statistically significant annual 
      increases in their HMRs of 3% and 4% respectively (p &lt; 0.05). A general, 
      though not statistically significant, decrease in the HMR was observed for all 
      age groups 50+ years. A fixed effects negative binomial regression model showed 
      that the HMR for males was higher than for females over the study period 
      [RRfemale/male = 0.473 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.621)], but no significant difference in 
      sex-specific trends in the HMR was found. CONCLUSION: An increasing risk of 
      homicide mortality was identified among Canadian youth, ages 15-24, over the 
      10-year study period. Research that seeks to understand the reasons for the 
      increased homicide risk facing Canada's youth, and public policy responses to 
      reduce this risk, are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of long-term mortality following tuberculosis 
      treatment are scarce. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate 
      the post-treatment mortality among tuberculosis survivors, and examine 
      differences in mortality risk by demographic and clinical characteristics. 
      METHODS: We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of 
      Systematic Reviews for cohort studies published in English between Jan 1, 1997, 
      and May 31, 2018. We included research papers that used a cohort study design, 
      included bacteriological or clinical confirmation of tuberculosis disease for all 
      participants, and reported, or provided enough data to calculate, mortality 
      estimates for people with tuberculosis and a valid control group representative 
      of the general population. We excluded studies that reported duplicate data, had 
      a study population of fewer than 50 people overall, had a follow-up period 
      shorter than 12 months after treatment completion, or had a loss to follow-up of 
      more than 30%. From eligible studies, we extracted standardised mortality ratios 
      (SMRs), or calculated them when the data were sufficient, by dividing the sum of 
      the observed deaths by the sum of the expected deaths. For studies that did not 
      report SMR as their mortality estimate, either mortality hazard ratios or 
      mortality rate ratios were extracted and pooled with SMRs. Random-effects 
      meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled SMRs. Between-study heterogeneity was 
      estimated with I(2). This study was prospectively registered in PROSPERO 
      (CRD42018092592). FINDINGS: Of the 7283 unique studies identified, data from ten 
      studies, reporting on 40 781 individuals and 6922 deaths, were included. The 
      pooled SMR for all-cause mortality among people with tuberculosis, compared with 
      the control group, was 2·91 (95% CI 2·21-3·84; I(2)=99%, 
      p(heterogeneity)<0·0001). When restricted to people with confirmed treatment 
      completion or cure, the pooled SMR was 3·76 (95% CI 3·04-4·66; I(2)=95%). Effect 
      estimates were similar when stratified by tuberculosis type, sex, age, and 
      country income category. Causes of mortality were extracted for 4226 deaths that 
      occurred post-treatment, with most deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease 
      (20% [95% CI 15-26]; I(2)=92%). INTERPRETATION: People treated for tuberculosis 
      have significantly increased mortality following treatment compared with the 
      general population or matched controls. These findings support the need for 
      further research to understand and address the biomedical and social factors that 
      affect the long-term prognosis of this population. FUNDING: None.

TI  - Tuberculosis among northern Manitoba First Nations, 2008-2012: program 
      performance on- and off-reserve.
PG  - 688-696
LID - 10.17269/s41997-019-00231-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) report tuberculosis (TB) 
      program performance for northern First Nations in the province of Manitoba; (2) 
      present methods for TB program performance measurement using routinely collected 
      surveillance data; and (3) advance dialogue on performance measurement of 
      Canadian TB programs. METHODS: Data on a retrospective cohort of people diagnosed 
      with TB in Manitoba between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010, and their 
      contacts, were extracted from the Manitoba TB Registry. Performance measures 
      based on US-CDC were analyzed. Adjusted probability ratios (aPR) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) were reported with comparisons between on-/off-reserve 
      First Nations, adjusted for age, sex, and treatment history. RESULTS: A cohort of 
      n = 149 people diagnosed with TB and n = 3560 contacts were identified. 
      Comparisons off-/on-reserve: Treatment completion (aPR = 1.03; 95% CI 
      0.995-1.07); early detection (aPR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.57-1.33); HIV testing and 
      reporting (aPR = 0.42; 95% CI 0.21-0.83); pediatric TB (age < 15 years) 
      (aPR = 1.20; 95% CI 0.47-3.06); retreatment for TB (aPR = 0.93; 95% CI 
      0.89-0.97); contact elicitation (aPR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.84-1.05); contact 
      assessment (aPR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.94). Pediatric (ages < 15 years) TB 
      incidence in northern Manitoba was 37.1 per 100,000/year. CONCLUSION: TB program 
      performance varies depending on residence in a reserve or non-reserve community. 
      Action is urgently needed to address TB program performance in terms of contact 
      investigation and HIV testing/reporting for First Nations off-reserve and to 
      address high rates of pediatric TB in northern Manitoba. First Nations 
      collaboration and models of care should be considered both on- and off-reserve to 
      improve TB program performance.

AB  - Rapid social, economic, and environmental changes in the northern territories of 
      Canada have raised concerns about potentially increasing levels of chronic 
      disease. This concern prompted us to compare multimorbidity prevalence in Canada 
      between the territories and provinces. We analyzed Canadian Community Health 
      Survey data for 2013/14. We defined multimorbidity, the outcome, as having 3 or 
      more chronic conditions and used survey-weighted multivariable logistic 
      regression for comparisons between territories and provinces. We found a 
      prevalence of multimorbidity in Canada of 14.0% (95% CI: 13.6, 14.3). We could 
      not find significant difference in multimorbidity prevalence between the 
      territories and provinces of Canada overall; however, the territories tended to 
      have lower prevalence estimates than provinces for multimorbidity (adj-OR = 0.88; 
      95% CI: 0.74-1.04). Sensitivity analyses from propensity score analyses had 
      similar conclusions. Effect modification analyses identified lower multimorbidity 
      in territories versus provinces among households without a post-secondary 
      graduate (adj-OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.34-0.61 for northern residence), males 
      (adj-OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54-0.93), and ages 12-29 years (adj-OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 
      0.39-0.99). Caution is needed in interpreting the results in light of 
      representativeness of CCHS in northern populations of Canada.

TI  - Experiential Aspects of Participation in Employment and Mobility for Adults With 
      Physical Disabilities: Testing Cross-Sectional Models of Contextual Influences 
      and Well-Being Outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use structural equation modeling to test research- and 
      theory-informed models of potential predictors and outcomes of subjective 
      experiences of employment and mobility participation in a national sample of 
      people with physical disabilities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: 
      Canada. PARTICIPANTS: English or French-speaking adults with a physical 
      impairment affecting mobility and restricting activities or participation, and 
      who participated in employment (n=457) or mobility (n=711) life domains. 
      INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed standardized 
      measures of perceived health, and employment-specific and/or mobility-specific 
      measures of perceived abilities, social support, accessibility and policies 
      (predictor variables); the Measure of Experiential Aspects of Participation 
      (MeEAP) in employment and/or mobility; and standardized measures of emotional 
      well-being, social well-being and life satisfaction (outcome variables). RESULTS: 
      Analyses using structural equation modeling showed that in both employment and 
      mobility domains, perceived health, abilities, social support, and accessibility 
      were positively related to experiential aspects of participation. Participation 
      experiences were positively related to social well-being, emotional well-being, 
      and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Results support and extend current theorizing 
      on participation experiences among adults with physical disabilities. 
      Intrapersonal and environmental factors may play a role in optimizing 
      participation experiences in employment and mobility which, in turn, may lead to 
      better well-being and life satisfaction. These results emphasize the importance 
      of conceptualizing participation from an experiential perspective and provide a 
      basis for advancing theory and practice to understand and improve the 
      participation experiences and well-being of adults living with physical 
      disabilities.

TI  - Post-tuberculosis mortality risk among immigrants to British Columbia, Canada, 
      1985-2015: a time-dependent Cox regression analysis of linked immigration, public 
      health, and vital statistics data.
PG  - 132-141

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare non-tuberculosis (non-TB)-cause mortality risk overall and 
      cause-specific mortality risks within the immigrant population of British 
      Columbia (BC) with and without TB diagnosis through time-dependent Cox 
      regressions. METHODS: All people immigrating to BC during 1985-2015 
      (N = 1,030,873) were included with n = 2435 TB patients, and the remaining as 
      non-TB controls. Outcomes were time-to-mortality for all non-TB causes, 
      respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and injuries/poisonings, 
      and were ascertained using ICD-coded vital statistics data. Cox regressions were 
      used, with a time-varying exposure variable for TB diagnosis. RESULTS: The 
      non-TB-cause mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 4.01 (95% CI 3.57-4.51) with 
      covariate-adjusted HR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.50-1.91). Cause-specific 
      covariate-adjusted mortality risk was elevated for respiratory diseases 
      (aHR = 2.96; 95% CI 2.18-4.00), cardiovascular diseases (aHR = 1.63; 95% CI 
      1.32-2.02), cancers (aHR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.13-1.75), and injuries/poisonings 
      (aHR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.25-2.72). CONCLUSIONS: In any given year, if an immigrant 
      to BC was diagnosed with TB, their risk of non-TB mortality was 69% higher than 
      if they were not diagnosed with TB. Healthcare providers should consider multiple 
      potential threats to the long-term health of TB patients during and after TB 
      treatment. TB guidelines in high-income settings should address TB survivor 
      health.

TI  - The contrasting role of nasopharyngeal angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
      transcription in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A cross-sectional study of people tested 
      for COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein serves as the host 
      receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to 
      understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in 
      people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and 
      SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary 
      protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) 
      age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of 
      transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 
      n = 424 "participants" aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was 
      performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 
      were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral 
      load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were 
      performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and 
      nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 
      (P = 0•092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0•00012) and 
      soluble (P<0•0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0•0001) was higher in 
      COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative 
      correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 
      diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription 
      of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load 
      (B = 0•49, R(2)=0•14, P<0•0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively 
      correlated (B= -0•85, R(2)= 0•26, P<0•0001), and no correlation was found with 
      TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0•042, R(2)=<0•10, P = 0•69). Multivariable analysis 
      showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high 
      transmembrane ACE2 transcription (Β= 0•89, 95%CI: [0•59 to 1•18]), while 
      transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA 
      load in the upper respiratory tract (Β= -0•099, 95%CI: [-0•18 to -0•022]). 
      INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role 
      in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the 
      transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the 
      soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for 
      age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2. FUNDING: This project (COV-55) 
      was funded by Genome British Columbia as part of their COVID-19 rapid response 
      initiative.

      effect was modified by receiving social grants. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, online 
      survey was conducted between December 2021 and May 2022. Primary outcome was 
      increased difficulty accessing food since the COVID-19 pandemic. Income change 
      was categorised as 'Decreased a lot', 'Decreased slightly' and 'Unchanged or 
      increased'. Multivariable logistic regressions were used, with an interaction 
      term between social grant receipt and income change. SETTING: eThekwini district, 
      South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: Youth aged 16-24 years. RESULTS: Among 1,620 
      participants, median age was 22 years (IQR 19-24); 861 (53 %) were women; 476 (29 
      %) reported increased difficulty accessing food; 297 (18 %) reported that income 
      decreased a lot, of whom 149 (50 %) did not receive social grants. Experiencing a 
      large income decrease was highly associated with increased difficulty accessing 
      food during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted OR [aOR] 3·63, 95 % CI 2·70, 4·88). 
      The aOR for the effect of a large income decrease on difficulty accessing food, 
      compared to no income change, were 1·49 (95 % CI 0·98, 2·28) among participants 
      receiving social grants, and 6·63 (95 % CI 4·39, 9·99) among participants not 
      receiving social grants. CONCLUSIONS: While social grant support made a great 
      difference in lowering the effect of income decrease on difficulty accessing 
      food, it was insufficient to fully protect youth from those difficulties. In 
      post-pandemic recovery efforts, there is a critical need to support youth through 
      economic empowerment programming and food schemes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Economic hardship is a potential trigger for intimate partner 
      violence (IPV) perpetration. While higher IPV rates have been reported in 
      low-income regions, few African studies have focused on IPV being triggered by 
      economic hardship among young men during the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore 
      estimated economic hardship's effect on IPV perpetration by young men in 
      eThekwini District, South Africa, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 pandemic experiences was conducted among youth 
      aged 16-24 years through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, including 
      questions about economic hardship (increased difficulty accessing food or 
      decreased income) and IPV perpetration. A prespecified statistical analysis plan 
      with a directed acyclic graph of assumed exposure, outcome, and confounder 
      relationships guided our analyses. We measured association of economic hardship 
      and IPV perpetration through odds ratios (ORs) computed from a multivariable 
      logistic regressions adjusted for measured confounders. Secondary outcomes of 
      physical and sexual IPV perpetration were analyzed separately using the same 
      specifications. Propensity score matching weights (PS-MW) were used in 
      sensitivity analyses. Analysis code 
      repository: https://github.com/CAndrewBasham/Economic_Hardship_IPV_perpetration/ 
      RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 12.5% reported perpetrating IPV, 67.6% of whom 
      reported economic hardship, compared with 45.6% of those not reporting IPV 
      perpetration (crude OR = 2.49). Median age was 22 years (interquartile range 
      20-24). Most (80%) were in a relationship and living together. Three quarters 
      identified as Black, 92.1% were heterosexual, and half had monthly 
      household income < R1600. We estimated an effect of economic hardship on the odds 
      of perpetrating IPV as OR = 1.83 (CI 0.98-3.47) for IPV perpetration overall, 
      OR = 6.99 (CI 1.85-36.59) for sexual IPV perpetration, and OR = 1.34 (CI 
      0.69-2.63) for physical IPV perpetration. PS-MW-weighted ORs for IPV perpetration 
      by economic hardship were 1.57 (overall), 4.45 (sexual), and 1.26 (physical). 
      CONCLUSION: We estimated 83% higher odds of self-reported IPV perpetration by 
      self-reported economic hardship among young South African men during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. The odds of sexual IPV perpetration were The seven-times higher by 
      economic hardship, although with limited precision. Among young men in South 
      Africa, economic hardship during COVID-19 was associated with IPV perpetration by 
      men. Our findings warrant culturally relevant and youth-oriented interventions 
      among young men to reduce the likelihood of IPV perpetration should they 
      experience economic hardship. Further research into possible causal mechanisms 
      between economic hardship and IPV perpetration could inform public health 
      measures in future pandemic emergencies.

TI  - Regional variation in multimorbidity prevalence in British Columbia, Canada: a 
      cross-sectional analysis of Canadian Community Health Survey data, 2015/16.
PG  - 225-234
LID - 10.24095/hpcdp.40.7/8.02 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multimorbidity represents a major concern for population health and 
      service delivery planners. Information about the population prevalence (absolute 
      numbers and proportions) of multimorbidity among regional health service delivery 
      populations is needed for planning for multimorbidity care. In Canada, health 
      region-specific estimates of multimorbidity prevalence are not routinely 
      presented. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is a potentially valuable 
      source of data for these estimates. METHODS: Data from the 2015/16 cycle of the 
      CCHS for British Columbia (BC) were used to estimate and compare multimorbidity 
      prevalence (3+ chronic conditions) through survey-weighted analyses. Crude 
      frequencies and proportions of multimorbidity prevalence were calculated by BC 
      Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). Logistic regression was used to estimate 
      differences in multimorbidity prevalence by HSDA, adjusting for known 
      confounders. Multiple imputation using chained equations was performed for 
      missing covariate values as a sensitivity analysis. The definition of 
      multimorbidity was also altered as an additional sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A 
      total of 681 921 people were estimated to have multimorbidity in BC (16.9% of the 
      population) in 2015/16. Vancouver (adj-OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44-0.97) and Richmond 
      (adj-OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37-0.82) had much lower prevalence of multimorbidity 
      than Fraser South (reference HSDA). Missing data analysis and sensitivity 
      analysis showed results consistent with the main analysis. CONCLUSION: 
      Multimorbidity prevalence estimates varied across BC health regions, and were 
      lowest in Vancouver and Richmond after controlling for multiple potential 
      confounders. There is a need for provincial and regional multimorbidity care 
      policy development and priority setting. In this context, the CCHS represents a 
      valuable source of information for regional multimorbidity analyses in Canada.

OAB - Multimorbidity prevalence is a growing phenomenon with major cost and service 
      delivery planning implications for health systems. This paper presents methods 
      and results for analysis of Canadian Community Health Survey data for British 
      Columbia (BC) during 2015/16. Estimated multimorbidity prevalence was lower in 
      Vancouver and Richmond compared to other regions in BC, after adjusting for 
      multiple confounding factors. Future research may seek to integrate multiple 
      health administrative and survey datasets to better characterize multimorbidity 
      among BC health regions. Policy development and priority setting for 
      multimorbidity care in BC are warranted provincially and within each RHA.
