## Overview

This page is a collection of guidance documents for reporting and reviewing quantitative bioscience research provided as a resource for authors, reviewers, and readers of biomedical and scientific research articles.

### Statistical Analysis and Reporting

#### SAMPL (Lang and Altman, 2013)

[**Basic Statistical Reporting for Articles Published in Biomedical Journals: The “Statistical Analyses and Methods in the Published Literature” or The SAMPLGuidelines**](https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SAMPL-Guidelines-6-27-13.pdf "SAMPL - Basic Statistical Reporting for Articles Published in Biomedical Journals: The “Statistical Analyses and Methods in the Published Literature” or The SAMPLGuidelines")

## BioMed Central (BMC) Standards of Reporting

This list was derived from [BMC's Standards of Reporting](https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/for-reviewers#reviewing+a+bmc+series+manuscript), which I shortened to the tools' name with URL link and the type of study they are designed for:

> -   Randomized controlled trials ([CONSORT](http://www.consort-statement.org/downloads))
>
> -   Protocols for randomized controlled protocols ([SPIRIT](http://www.spirit-statement.org/))
>
> -   Systematic reviews and meta-analyses\* ([PRISMA](http://www.prisma-statement.org/)) and protocols ([PRISMA-P](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma-protocols/))
>
> -   Observational studies ([STROBE](http://www.strobe-statement.org/))
>
> -   Case reports ([CARE](http://www.care-statement.org/))
>
> -   Qualitative research ([COREQ](http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349.long))
>
> -   Diagnostic/prognostic studies ([STARD](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/stard/)and [TRIPOD](http://www.tripod-statement.org/TRIPOD/TRIPOD-Checklists/TRIPOD-Checklist-Prediction-Model-Development-and-Validation))
>
> -   Economic evaluations ([CHEERS](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/80))
>
> -   Pre-clinical animal studies ([ARRIVE](http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines))
>
> -   Statistics checklists for editors and reviewers to use when evaluating the statistics in manuscripts:
>
